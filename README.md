# Johnaco Editor

A simple but highly customizable React-based code editor.

You know what to do, just `npm i` then `npm run dev`. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Demo: https://johncrowley-s2.github.io/fluree-editor/

This code is in the very early stages of development so everything can and most definitely will change...


## TODO:
- Finish autocomplete. Make it easily customizable.
- Finish hover card. Make it also easily customizable.
- Fix the typing wonkiness that sometimes happens when tokens/characters get swallowed by the lexer.
- Find a way to only render the visible text in the viewport to improve performance for large documents.
