# Johnaco Editor

A simple but highly customizable React-based code editor.

You know what to do, just `npm i` then `npm run dev`. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Demo: https://johncrowley-s2.github.io/johnaco-editor/

This code is in the very early stages of development so everything can and most definitely will change...


## TODO:
- Write good docs.
- Write plenty of unit tests.
- Figure what to do about the handleEnter() function.
- Animations? maybe...or not.
- Find a way to only render the visible text in the viewport to improve performance for large documents.
- Other optimizations (throttling/debouncing functions, memoization, etc...).
